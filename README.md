### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick, a principal cloud architect working at [EscherCloudAI](https://eschercloud.com) on various things, mostly related to cloud (native) technologies with a particular focus on AI, ML and HPC workloads.

I have a sporadically updated blog [here](https://dischord.org), and you can find me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/yankcrime).
