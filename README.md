### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick, I work on various things - mostly related to Cloud Native technologies with a particular focus on AI, ML and HPC workloads.

I'm also a [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) and an [OpenUK Ambassador](https://openuk.uk/profiles/nick-jones/).

I have a sporadically updated blog [here](https://dischord.org), and you can find me in the Fediverse [here](https://sausage.social/@nick).
